# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms are one of the most intuitive algorithms. Whenever we see a problem we first try to apply some greedy strategy to get the answer(**we humans are greedy, aren't we :P ?**). 

Greedy approaches are quite simple and easy to understandBut many times the proving part might be difficult.

• Greedy Algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment.

• You hope that by choosing a local optimum ateach step, you will end up at a global optimum.

## Advantages of Greedy Approach
The algorithm is easier to describe.
This algorithm can perform better than other algorithms (but, not in all cases).

## Drawback of Greedy Approach
The greedy algorithm doesn't always produce the optimal solution. This is the major disadvantage of the algorithm .



## How can you prove that a greedy algorithm is optimal?
There are two ways to prove that a greedy algorithm is optimal. They are:


**1. ‘Greedy stays ahead’ arguments :-**

Using a ‘Greedy stays ahead’ argument is one of the simplest methods to prove that a greedy algorithm is correct. It shows that according to some measure, the greedy algorithm always is at least as far ahead as the optimal solution during each iteration of the algorithm. This fact can be used to prove that the greedy algorithm is optimal.



**2. Exchange Arguments :-**


This is a rather versatile technique. It essentially shows you that it is possible for you to iteratively transform any optimal solution into the solution produced by the greedy algorithm without making any change .
